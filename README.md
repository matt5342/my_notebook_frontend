My Notebook:

A React application to create your personal notebook.
This application was build just after learning the fundamentals of the React framework, and uses Rails as an API on the backend.

A user can name their notebook, add chapters, and pages within those chapters.

Uses client side JSON web tokens to keep user passowords secure.
